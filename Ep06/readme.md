# Episode-06 libuv and async IO

# Understanding `Synchronous `and `Asynchronous`

## Overview

## libuv

Libuv is a library written in the programming language C that helps nodejs to improve efficiency while running tasks parallelly. However, nodejs already have async API's. It uses Libuvs's thread pools if async API is not available in nodejs and processes are blocking the operations. Libuv doesn't perform the task itself, it only manages the operations.

- Event-driven asynchronous I/O model is integrated.
- It allows the CPU and other resources to be used simultaneously while still performing I/O operations, thereby resulting in efficient use of resources and network.
- It facilitates an event-driven approach wherein I/O and other activities are performed using callback-based notifications.

## Synchronous Javascript
In synchronous programming, operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically each line of code waits for the previous one to finish before proceeding to the next. This means that the program executes in a predictable, linear order, with each task being completed before the next one starts.

## Asynchronous Javascript
Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple tasks to run independently of each other. In asynchronous code, a task can be initiated, and while waiting for it to complete, other tasks can proceed. This non-blocking nature helps improve performance and responsiveness, especially in web applications.

### Synchronous Vs Asynchronous execution

-   **Synchronous execution:**

    -   Tasks execute sequentially, one after another
    -   Each task must complete before the next one begins
    -   Blocking in nature - the program waits for each operation to complete
    -   Single-threaded execution is sufficient

-   **Asynchronous execution:**

    -   Multiple tasks can run simultaneously (multiple operations at a time).
    -   Non-blocking in nature - program continues execution while waiting for operations
    -   At least more than one thread is required.
        -   This can be achieved through concurrency or parallelism.

**NOTE:**

-   Javascript (JAVASCRIPT ENGINE) is synchronous, single-threaded (i.e., Javascript engine can run only one operation at a time)

### How Javascript shows Asynchronous behaviour?

-   Runtime environments provide the ability to handle asynchronous tasks to the Javascript engine.

    -   **Browser Runtime** provides event loop, callback queue, microtask queue and browser API's (like [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) etc.)
    -   **Node Runtime** provides libuv library with event-driven architecture.

-   Following are considered as async tasks in javascript

    -   I/O tasks
        -   File operation
        -   Network calls etc.
    -   Timer
        -   Javascript does not have built-in timers; it relies on the runtime to provide them.

### Simple workflow of handling async tasks

1. Main Thread (Synchronous)
    - Executes Javascript code line by line
    - When it encounters async tasks, delegates them to runtime
2. Runtime environment
    - Handles async tasks separately (not on the main thread)
    - Browser Runtime:
        - Handles the tasks using browser API's
        - Puts completed tasks in callback queue/microtask queue
    - Libuv:
        - Handles the task using Libuv's libraries and thread pool
        - Puts completed tasks in callback queue/microtask queue
3. Event Loop
    - Continuously checks if the main thread is idle.
    - Moves callbacks from queue to main thread.

### Simple Async code execution

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const https = require("https");

console.log("Hello World");

var a = 987654321;
var b = 123456789;

https.get("https://dummyjson.com/products/1", (res) =>
    console.log("Data Fetched Successfully")
);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("setTimeout called for 5 sec");
}, 5000);

fs.readFile(__dirname + "/file.txt", "utf-8", (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
});

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

var c = multiply(a, b);
console.log(c);

console.log("End of sync execution");
```

**Output:**




### What is libuv library

-   [`libuv`](https://libuv.org/) is an open-source cross platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based operations. Originally designed for Node.js
-   Features of libuv

    -   Event Loop
    -   Thread Pool
    -   Asynchronous I/O
    -   Cross platform compatibility

### How Node.js is utilizing libuv to achieve Async I/O?

### What is libuv's thread pool?

TODO:

### Why the term "Asynchronous I/O"

-   All the I/O tasks are delegated to libuv and it executes them asynchronously using thread pool, so they get executed parallelly with main thread, hence Async I/O.
-   This Asynchronous I/O nature leads to Non-Blocking I/O nature.

### Why the term "Non-Blocking I/O"

-   Since all the I/O tasks are delegated to libuv and running on thread pool leaves main thread unblocked with I/O tasks.
-   None of the I/O tasks are blocking the main thread, hence Non-Blocking I/O

### Why Non-Blocking I/O is advantageous?

-   Usually all I/O tasks makes CPU sit idle until they receive response which is wastage of resources.
-   Since Javascript is single threaded until the current request is resolved no other requests will be served (assumin you are running only one server instance)

# Appendix

### What is callback queue (task queue)?

-   After executing I/O tasks, JavaScript runtimes add them to the callback queue.
-   The event loop then picks these tasks from the callback queue and adds them to the call stack.

### Callback queue vs Microtask queue

-   Task queue handles
    -   setTimeout/setInterval callbacks
    -   I/O operations
-   Microtask queue handles
    -   Promise callbacks
-   Microtask queue has higher priority, task queue will only be handled if microtask queue is empty.

### Concurrency Vs Parallelism

**Concurrency:**

-   Multiple threads take turns executing on a single processor core
-   Tasks are managed through context switching - the processor switches between threads
-   Can be achieved on a single core processor
-   Threads appear to run simultaneously but are actually taking turns

**Parallelism:**

-   Multiple threads execute simultaneously on different processor cores
-   No context switching needed between parallel threads
-   Requires multi-core processor hardware
-   Threads truly run at the same time independently
